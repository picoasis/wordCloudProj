The Hydrogen Council, an industry
consortium,reckons some 350 big projects
are under way globally to develop cleanhydrogen production, hydrogen­distribution facilities and industrial plants which
will use hydrogen for processes which now
use fossil fuels (see map). They will have
electricity demands in the tens and hundreds of gigawatts, on a par with those of
large countries, and are slated to receive
$500bn of public and private investment
between now and 2030. That expenditure
could end up embarrassing governments
and enraging shareholders if today’s high
expectations do not pan out.
Hydrogen had its enthusiasts long before climate change became an issue. Its
appeal was threefold. It is very energydense: burning a kilogram of it provides
2.6 times more energy than burning a kilogram of natural gas. When burned in air it
produces none of the sulphates or carbon
monoxide through which fossil fuels damage air quality both outdoors and in,
though it does produce some oxides of nitrogen; when used in a fuel cell, a device
that uses the reaction between hydrogen
and oxygen to produce electricity without
combustion, it produces nothing but water. And because it can be made by electrolysis, or from coal, it was held to free its
consumers from the tyranny of oil producers—an advantage which, after the oil
shocks of the 1970s, accounted for the first
serious spurt of interest in hydrogen on
the part of governments, as opposed to
maverick visionaries.
The fact that the enthusiasm dates back
so far, though, has become an energy industry joke:“Hydrogen is the fuel ofthe future—and it always will be.” The problem is
thatthere is no natural source of hydrogen;
on Earth, most of it is bound up with other
molecules like those of fossil fuels, or biomass, or water. The laws of thermodynam
